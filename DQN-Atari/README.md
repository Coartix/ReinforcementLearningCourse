## DQN-Atari Project from DeepMind paper [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](./nature14236.pdf)  

#### This project is a part of the Reinforcement Learning course at EPITA (2023).  

This project is using gym and torch modules to train a Deep Q-Network on the Atari Breakout game.  

You'll find the implementation inside the `torch_DQL.ipynb` notebook.  
The parameters chosen for the training are the ones from the paper, except for the memory size that had to be reduced to fit in the RAM of my small computer ðŸ˜ž  

The training can take many hours to complete depending on your hardware and the number of episodes you want to train on.  

The DQN network can be found inside the `DQN_torch.py`, the memory inside `ReplayBuffer.py` and the video function inside `create_video.py`.  

The notebook contains simple and straightforward usage of the functions.  

#### What has been done:

- The memory size had to be reduced to fit in the RAM of my small computer  

- The training time is very long, even with a GPU  

- The training is not very stable, as it sometimes reduces the rewards  

- Many repositories replicate the paper's result using Tensorflow, this one does it in Pytorch  

- A video function has been added to visualize the result of the agent after training  

#### Next:

I'm looking forward to make a model playing Breakout based on a Decision Transformer.
